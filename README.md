# ski-ticket-monitor

Prerequisite:
Store the correct variable in .env file, you can refer to [.env.example](./.env.example)

Steps to run the project locally

```
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

Before commit, remove dist/ and run `npm run build` since it's easier for me to deploy with web already built.
